# Pseudo Code: Ad Agency Budget Management System

## Overview

This system is designed to manage advertising budgets for multiple brands. Each brand has a daily and monthly budget and runs campaigns that can only be active within allowed time windows (dayparting). The system enforces budget limits, schedules resets, and applies dayparting rules.

---

## Entities

### Brand

* Attributes:

  * name: string
  * daily\_budget: number
  * monthly\_budget: number
  * daily\_spend: number (resets daily)
  * monthly\_spend: number (resets monthly)

### Campaign

* Attributes:

  * name: string
  * brand\_id: reference to Brand
  * is\_active: boolean
  * start\_hour: integer (0-23)
  * end\_hour: integer (0-23)

---

## Tasks and Logic

### 1. Enforce Budget Limits

```
For each brand:
    If brand.daily_spend >= brand.daily_budget OR brand.monthly_spend >= brand.monthly_budget:
        Deactivate all campaigns for that brand
    Else:
        Mark all campaigns for that brand as eligible for reactivation (subject to dayparting)
```

### 2. Enforce Dayparting

```
current_hour = get current hour in Eastern Time (GMT-4)

For each campaign:
    If campaign is eligible (not over budget):
        If start_hour <= current_hour < end_hour:
            campaign.is_active = True
        Else:
            campaign.is_active = False
```

### 3. Daily Reset

```
At midnight each day (Eastern Time):
    For each brand:
        brand.daily_spend = 0

    Trigger enforce_budget_limits task
    Trigger enforce_dayparting task
```

### 4. Monthly Reset

```
On the 1st day of each month (Eastern Time):
    For each brand:
        brand.monthly_spend = 0

    Trigger enforce_budget_limits task
    Trigger enforce_dayparting task
```

---

## Execution Order

```
1. enforce_budget_limits
2. enforce_dayparting
3. daily_reset -> enforce_budget_limits -> enforce_dayparting
4. monthly_reset -> enforce_budget_limits -> enforce_dayparting
```

---

## Notes

* Timezone is Eastern Time (GMT-4)
* Daily and monthly budgets are **independent**
* Campaigns should never be active if either budget is exceeded
* Dayparting is only checked after passing budget constraints
